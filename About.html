      <i>Form Notifications</i> was created as an sample add-on, and is meant
      for demonstration purposes only. It should not be used for complex or
      important workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
      The number of notifications this add-on produces are limited by the owner's
      available email quota; it will not send email notifications if the owner's
      daily email quota has been exceeded. Collaborators using this add-on on the
      same form will be able to adjust the notification settings, but will not be
      able to disable the notification triggers set by other collaborators.
